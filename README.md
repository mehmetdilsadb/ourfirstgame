Pacman Game with Raylib Library
This project is a Pacman game developed using the Raylib library, created by first-year university students.

Description    
The Pacman game is a classic arcade game where the player controls Pacman through a maze, eating dots and avoiding ghosts. Our implementation includes several features:

Player Controls: Use the arrow keys to move Pacman through the maze.
Gameplay Mechanics: Eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding ghosts. Eating special dots allows Pacman to eat ghosts briefly.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the score as Pacman eats dots.
Levels: Implement multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
